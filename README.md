[Good Code Reviews, Better Code Reviews](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/good-code-reviews-better-code-reviews/) If I'm honest, I find that posts on the "code review" sometimes have the unfortunate consequence of inducing checklist fatigue. Gergely Orosz approaches it from a refreshingly simple and concise angle, contrasting `good vs. better` in an empathetic and humble way.

[Is It Worth the Time?](https://xkcd.com/1205/) XKCD comic that illustrates time saved over 5 years given how often the task is performed and how long the task takes. Don't forget to hover over the comic to read the cheeky tooltip.

[10 Things Everyone Needs to Know about Site Reliability Engineering](https://blog.newrelic.com/technology/site-reliability-engineering-careers/) If you work at a company where the SRE function is new, a quick primer makes a world of difference in understanding how to better interface and support this team. Not everyone has time to read Google's SRE handbook; this is a clear and time-efficient alternative.
